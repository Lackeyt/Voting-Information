## Description

_This webpge is designed for the Week 1 project at Epicodus. It's purpose is to demonstrate understanding or mastery of lessons taught in the first week,
  utilizing all elements covered in the course up to this point. The page primarily consists of wells and 2 left floats that categorize different elements
  and allow for an image background to not washout the text. Interests was floated left for layout and formatting reasons. Links to the github repositories
  of my other projects from the week are organized in a verticle button set and floated left to not interfere with the other body text. The rest is is made
  up of an About Me section and some background on myself; plain text organized into grids / wells to ensure the semi-transparent background text doesn't
  overlap with the left floated elements._
